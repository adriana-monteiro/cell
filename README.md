# Cancer Blood Cell Classification: A Deep Learning Project

This is a project made for the Deep Learning course of the Master's in Data Science and Advanced Analytics of NOVA IMS. The objective was to use deep learning techniques to solve a supervised machine learning problem. The chosen problem was an image classification task of blood cell cancer (details in [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadamireshraghi/blood-cell-cancer-all-4class)).

## Key Project Components:
The project is divided in different notebooks:
1. Data Exploration ([explore.ipynb](https://github.com/adriana-monteiro/cell-cancer-classification/blob/main/notebooks/explore.ipynb))
3. Data Preprocessing ([preprocessing.ipynb](https://github.com/adriana-monteiro/cell-cancer-classification/blob/main/notebooks/preprocessing.ipynb))
4. Model Handcrafting ([model handcrafted.ipynb](https://github.com/adriana-monteiro/cell-cancer-classification/blob/main/notebooks/model%20handcrafted.ipynb))
5. Model Hyper Search ([model hyper search.ipynb](https://github.com/adriana-monteiro/cell-cancer-classification/blob/main/notebooks/model%20hyper%20search.ipynb))
6. Transfer Learning  ([model handcrafted.ipynb](https://github.com/adriana-monteiro/cell-cancer-classification/blob/main/notebooks/transfer.ipynb))
7. Other optional techniques ([optional_1.ipynb](https://github.com/adriana-monteiro/cell-cancer-classification/blob/main/notebooks/optional_1.ipynb))
